custom hooks can be pretty good to keep things clean. 

should add more new techniques for every assignment just to get into them 
(still doing side projects but usually i don't have them in muscles memory)

MUI can be nice to get early prototypes going, kinda rough to learn all the attributes and how to override stuff.
Seen alot of companies using MUI, i don't like it all but I guess people like it. (i think people are just lazy to create their own components).
